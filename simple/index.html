              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <br>
              <P>One of the major uses of Navigation based applications is Location-Based Services (LBS) which constitutes a significant portion of the navigation application usage. The availability of location-sensitive smartphones, with wireless broadband high-speed connections, has made low-cost applications available to a huge audience and there exists a lot of innovation in designing new types of technology and applications using these devices. Typically, it is seen that outdoor positioning is generally GPS/GNSS based. However, indoor positioning is generally based on WLAN technology. The primary reason is that GPS generally does not work for indoor applications. Uninterrupted good accuracy positioning needs thinking in the fusion of multiple technologies (Smart Phone Sensors, Wi-Fi, BLE beacons, GNSS, Dead Reckoning, etc.) to deliver a seamless outdoor and indoor positioning experience. To design/develop new ideas and mobile apps which make use of these technologies (and even other signals of opportunity) to provide seamless indoor-outdoor positioning and provide innovative location-based services.</P>

              <center><h2>1.Introduction:</h2></center>
              <br>
              <p>With current GPS Technology seamless navigation is possible for a person who has a smartphone. We can able to track down our location, wherever on Earth by GPS.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Consider a person who gets to attend an important examination. But his exam center is located in a remote place. GPS tracks down in spite of the remote location. But the real problem arises here. Once he gets there, he finds many campuses and infrastructure. When he needs to locate his exam hall, GPS is of no use. Even though GPS tracks the hardest location, it is limited to a certain point of location and it could not give the exact indoor location. A panic scenario starts as he couldn’t able to find his examination hall at the right time. Indoor accuracy is the greatest drawback of GPS.</p>
              <br>
              <P>This problem can be overcome by IPS ( Indoor Positioning System). Even though IPS can be
                seen /developed, it is not widespread due to its limitations like external hardware requirements and smartphone sensor abilities. Mostly they are limited to a particular organisation and cannot be used by common people. </P>
              
            <br><p>IPS can be seen in supermarkets, Malls, and companies. It works only in that particular area which gains profits and advantages to those companies, whereas the common man gets no use of it as he could not use it whenever he desires. Common people are being affected by this in various situations. Take a real situation, where a patient is admitted to a hospital, which lacks nurses. When he is in need of a nurse, the person who is accompanying the patient tries to find the nurse but she is nowhere to be found. As the person doesn’t know in which room she would be in.</p>
              <p>Even in Factories which has different sectors, accidents may take place anywhere in those
                sectors. But without IPS, members who need to save the people couldn’t be able track down the exact position of the incident. Alike this there are so many places like airports, movie theatres, parking garages, stadiums, etc.. which are in need of IPS.</p>
              
              <br>  <P>To overcome all these problems our project gives a valid solution only by using smartphones and their available sensors. As each and every building has a WIFI signal, with the help of it and our designed app, we would be able to provide Indoor Positioning System. As soon as the person opens his phone to track his room/class, our app provides the signal which eventually led to the desired place. This works just like GPS right? Yes Of course. Along with the magnificent work of both GPS and IPS, we can track any location within a span of time.</P>  
              
              <br><p>Due to this students might easily get to their examination hall without any stress. Advanced nurse calling systems could locate the nearest nurse. Several people can be saved from accidents in factories.</p>
              <br><p>Our main ambition is to provide an easy tracker which can be used in day-to-day life by any
                person who has a smartphone and can track the location just like GPS</p><br>

              <h2>2.1 Modules:</h2>
              <p>The Framework contains three main categories of modules, Mapping, Navigation, and Visualisation tools.</p><br>
              <h2>2.1.1 Mapping Modules: </h2>
              <p>Tools in this module can be used to develop applications to map locations in three different realms - WIFI, BLE, and Dead-Reckoning.</p><br>

                <div class="sub2">
                  <h2>SMD3 (3D Spatial movement Data):</h2><br>
                  <p>Mapping modules can be used to record SMD3. All mapping modules follow our framework’s standard model, handling 3d Spatial movement Data (as .SMD3 file).  All modules in the framework support importing, exporting, and processing .smd3 maps.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <br>
              <h2>2.1.1.1 GNSS:</h2>
              <p>GNSS-based location computation is the primary mode for outdoor navigation. All the mapping modules in the <span class="red28">framework use Global Navigation Satellite System data in the model creation algorithms for calibrating the in-app coordinate systems</span>. Methods in this module can also be used directly to create a GPS application </p><br>              <hr>
              <br>
              <h2>2.1.1.2 Dead reckoning:</h2><!--img-->
              <p>Dead reckoning, determination without the aid of live GNSS of the position, from the record of the courses walked, the distance made (which can be estimated from velocity), the known starting point (identified using the WIFI or BLE module), and the known or estimated drift. The MEMS sensors present in most smartphones are not so accurate, they produce noise in the data which makes computing velocity and angle tricky. Also during navigation, we need to distinguish between the user moving his hands and walking. To account for these conditions, we have developed an ML-based algorithm for onboard real-time error correction. Which acts as a low pass filter to the noise in the data and ignores casual hand movements, bumping up the accuracy.</p><br>
              <hr><br>
              <h2>2.1.1.3 WIFI:</h2>
              <p>The WIFI module can be used to record Wifi signal strengths data models (RSSI - Received Signal Strength Information) as a .iap file, the algorithm can precisely compute the coordinates with these models when navigating. Recording the WIFI RSSI can be mapped with any wifi-enabled edge devices without actually connecting to any of those WIFI networks being scanned.</p><br>
              <h2>2.1.1.3.1 WIFI Repeaters:</h2>
              <p>Many companies/Malls/Institutes use WIFI Repeaters for seamless connectivity throughout their campus, WIFI SSID (Service Set IDentifier) for these repeaters will be the same, rendering the WIFI RSSI based applications useless. However in our framework, in order to account for this, we implemented <span class="red28"> additional parameters in the WIFI mapping process which involves capturing the GPS coordinates </span>from the GNSS module (WIFI repeaters will be separated by distance on the scale of tens of meters which falls in the level where GNSS can be used to distinguish between various repeaters) </p><br>
              <h2>2.1.1.3.2 Signal Strength Variations Between Devices</h2>
              <p>Signal Strength readings taken at the same location with two different devices will be different, due to the phone’s WIFI antenna hardware. To take this into account we developed an algorithm (which we call “The Signal Relation Computer Algorithm”), which <span class="red28">Based on experiments on the same, we fine-tuned the system.</span></p><br>
              <br>
              <div class="light">
                <h2>The Signal Relation Computer Algorithm</h2>
                <p>Using the fact that if a particular signal is recorded with strength, attenuated by a factor of x with respect to the reference in a particular antenna, then for this given antenna, all the signals will be recorded with the same factor x</p><br>  
              </div>
              <br>
              <h2>2.1.1.3.3 Portable Hotspots</h2>
              <p>When mapping to avoid polluting the model with portable hotspots (temporary mobile AP) our mapping module can differentiate between these. Mobile devices use an ipv4 range of 192.168.43.1 to 192.168.43.254 so <span class="red28"> it is possible to differentiate mobile AP from ACTUAL wifi </span>based on this.</p><br>

              <h2>2.1.2.1 Accelerometer</h2>
              <p>An accelerometer is an electronic sensor that measures the acceleration forces acting on an object, to determine the object’s position in space and monitor the object’s movement. Acceleration, which is a vector quantity, is the rate of change of an object’s velocity (velocity being the displacement of the object divided by the change in time). <span class="red28">We are fusing the accelerometer readings with the data from the gyroscope and G-sensor</span>to calculate the distance travelled.</p><br>
              <hr><br>
              <h2>2.1.2.2 Gyroscope</h2>
              <p>A gyroscope sensor is a device that can measure and maintain the orientation and angular velocity of an object. These are more advanced than accelerometers. These can measure the tilt and lateral orientation of the object whereas an accelerometer can only measure the linear motion. <span class="red28"> We use the gyroscope readings to differentiate between walking and casual hand movements.</span>Combined with other sensors this is used for computing the walking distances.</p><br>
              <hr><br>
              <h2>2.1.2.3 GPS</h2>
              <p>The Device’s GPS (Global Positioning System) is being used to get the latitude and longitude of the device for outdoor navigation and for indoors, the <span class="red28">GPS is used for calibrating the in-app coordinate systems at equal intervals </span></p><br>
              <hr><br>
              <h2>2.1.2.4 Magnetic-field</h2>
              <p>We use the device’s onboard magnetic field sensor to measure the magnetic field strengths in the X Y and Z axis to compute the device’s angle with respect to north. This data also plays an <span class="red28"> important role in the real-time error correction module that we implemented</span></p><br>
              <hr><br>
              <h2>2.1.2.5 RSSI</h2>
              <p>The  RSSI (Received Signal Strength Information) is the primary data that the WIFI and BLE modules depend on. We collect the WIFI/BLE beacon strength process it using <span class="red28">The Signal Relation Computer Algorithm </span>to precisely compute the location indoors.</p><br>
              <hr><br>
              <h2>2.1.2.6 G-sensor</h2>
              <p>We use the gravity sensor data in most of the modules for <span class="red28"> calibrating the orientations and error corrections.</span>The iap model creation algorithm uses this data to analyze variations in the pattern extensively for improving the accuracy of the maps.</p><br>
              <hr><br>
              <h2>2.1.3 Mapping Methods:</h2>
              <p>We defined several standards for mapping indoors using our modules. These standard mapping methods can be followed or depending upon the  problem, developers can develop their mapping standards</p><br>
              <h2>2.1.3.1 Wall mapping:</h2><!--img-->
              <p>In wall mapping, there are two standards (default) for drawing walls. When creating an indoor map using the real-time mapping module the device being used for mapping needs to qualify the auto-config testing, which estimates the device’s quality for recording high precision 3D spatial movement data.And the module automatically configures the drawings based on the user’s movement as follows.</p><br>
              <center>
                <ol>
                  <li>While walking in the anticlockwise direction, the wall will be drawn to the right of the reference pointer. </li>
                  <li>While walking in the clockwise direction, the wall will be drawn to the left of the reference pointer</li>
                </ol>

              <p>In this mode the user needs to walk close to the wall tracing its perimeters. Works with closed polygons (concave and convex) and open structures (buildings/structures that are not closed)</p><br>
              <p>Data from this module will have metadata for the online editor to recognise this as wall mapping data, which will be reflected in the rendering process. (elevation in z-axis and shadows in rendering)</p>

              <h2>2.1.3.2 Path mapping:</h2><!--img-->
              <p>Similar to wall mapping methods, we have defined standards for mapping walkable areas. Path mapping requires the same specs as wall mapping. The process is also similar, the user who is mapping should walk through the Campus dt holding the smartphone pointing the way they walk.</p><br>
              <p>The intersection points in the path will be recognised by the module, and path joint nodes will be added automatically which will be later used in the navigation, for path computation to the destination. These nodes can be added or edited manually with the map editor (more will be discussed in their respective sections).</p><br>
              <p>The image shown here is the render of an actual path mapping data (Rendered using recon Framework’s spatial movement visualisation tools)</p><br>
              <h2>2.1.3.3 Node Mapping:</h2>
              <p>There are two main categories of node clusters in our IPS maps,<span class="red28">Des_Nodes</span><span>and</span><span class="red28">Nav_Node</span> these nodes are used for locating destinations and navigation.</p><br>
              <h2>Des_Nodes:</h2>
              <p>Des_Node are markers that can be placed over the map to identify rooms/locations on the map. It can contain location names, notes/descriptions,s, and constraints. When mapping the path, des_Nodes can be added, later in the online map editor, the user can update the name and other parameters.</p><br>
              <h2>Nav_Node:</h2>
              <p>Nav_Nodes are auto-generated by the algorithms at junctions and turnings. This can also be added manually. These nav_nodes are used for finding the connecting path between the user’s current location and the destination Des_node.</p><br>

              <h2>2.1.3.4 WIFI / BLE  mapping:</h2>
              <p>In WIFI / BLE mapping, We receive RSSI information continuously in intervals of time to generate the .iap model and draw the map. This happens simultaneously with other mappings (Path mapping and wall Mapping).</p><br>

              <h2>Rendering smd3 (3D Spatial movement Data):</h2>
              <p>Using this framework, developers can create applications that can visualise Spatial movement data paths. The rendering modules support all types of spatial movement data collected using any of the mapping modules from the recon framework because they all follow the same standards of spatial movement mapping defined by us in the recon framework.</p><br>
              <h2>2D rendering:</h2>
              <p>A 2D path can be generated in three different ways: common Parameter: Time period (tracing path in that particular time period)</p><br>

              <p>We have made our advanced online map editor with which users can edit sync their map scans to the universal indoor model and with this editor they can also create a custom IPS application (specifically made for an organisation) Users can add names, description to the nodes in the map, can manually add new nodes by simply drag and dropping new node from the side panel 
                Users can also export their maps as image/smd3 files from this site directly. All their contribution will be linked to their accounts. Developers can modify this template to build their custom map editor based on requirements. The codes are well documented</p><br>
